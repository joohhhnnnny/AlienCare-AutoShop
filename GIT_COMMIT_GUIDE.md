git status

# See detailed diff (optional)
git diff .gitignore
git diff resources/views/app.blade.php

# Stage all changes at once
git add -A

# Or stage selectively if you prefer
git add .gitignore
git add resources/
git add dev-tools/
git add CLEANUP_*.md VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md

```

## Step 4: Verify the Commit

```bash
# See the commit
git log -1 --stat

# See what will be pushed
git log origin/code-cleaning..HEAD
```

## Step 5: Push to Remote (Optional)

```bash
# Push to your branch
git push origin code-cleaning

# Or push to specific branch
git push origin HEAD:code-cleaning
```

## Verification After Commit

```bash
# Verify all files were committed
git ls-files | grep -E "(theme\.|api-test\.|test-reservation\.)" | sort

# Verify deleted files
git ls-files | grep -E "(backup_database|test_system|import_data|debug_api|test_reservation_modal)" | wc -l
# Should return 0 (no results)

# Verify dev-tools is not tracked
git status
# Should NOT show any dev-tools/ files as untracked
```

## Quick Commit (One-liner)

If you prefer a shorter commit message:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: remove inline styles/scripts and organize dev tools"
```

## Undo (if needed)

If you need to undo the commit:

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

## Integration with CI/CD

Your CI/CD pipeline will:
1. ‚úÖ Skip the `dev-tools/` directory (it's in .gitignore)
2. ‚úÖ Use the external CSS/JS files from `resources/`
3. ‚úÖ Build with Vite (includes theme.ts and other new files)
4. ‚úÖ Deploy clean code with no inline styles/scripts

## Build Verification

After pushing, your build should:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Check public/build/ for all assets
ls -la public/build/

# Verify no inline code in output
grep -r "style=\"" public/build/
grep -r "onclick=\"" public/build/
# Both should return NO results
```

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

After committing, verify:

- [x] Git shows commit was successful
- [x] `dev-tools/` is NOT showing in `git status`
- [x] All new CSS/JS files are committed
- [x] All deleted files are removed from repo
- [x] Build succeeds with `npm run build`
- [x] No console errors in development
- [x] Theme switching still works

## Summary

```bash
# One command to do everything:
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: remove inline styles/scripts and organize dev tools" && git push origin code-cleaning
```

Then verify with:
```bash
git log -1 --stat
```
